Test in the 1950s laid the groundwork for inception.
Early endeavors in language translation emerged in the late
1950s and early 1960s, exemplified by the Georgetown-IBM
experiment’s Russian-to-English translations. The 1970s witnessed the advent of rule-based systems and initial forays
into language syntax and semantics analysis. By the 1980s,
statistical methods gained traction, buoyed by advancements
in computational linguistics and machine learning, with techniques like statistical machine translation and n-gram language
models rising to prominence.
The turn of the millennium marked a significant shift
towards machine learning-based approaches, particularly with
the rise of deep learning techniques. Architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural net-
works and transformer models revolutionized various
NLP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in machine
translation, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. Pretrained language models like BERT and GPT further propelled
NLP advancements, enabling transfer learning and fine-tuning
for diverse downstream tasks.
NLP encompasses a spectrum of analyses and tasks, from
semantic and syntactic analysis to pragmatic considerations
like discourse analysis and conversational agent design. Information retrieval and extraction tackle the extraction of pertinent data from vast text collections, while sentiment analysis
discerns textual sentiment or opinion. Machine translation
focuses on automatic language translation while question-answering systems aim to comprehend and respond accurately
to natural language queries.
The lineage of virtual assistants can be traced back to
the 1960s, with early prototypes like ”Shakey the Robot”
demonstrating the potential for machine perception and inter-
action. The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of intelligent
software agents and expert systems, laying the groundwork for
virtual assistants proficient in natural language understanding
and task execution within specific domains. The term ”virtual
assistant” gained prominence in the early 2000s with products
like Microsoft’s Clippy and Apple’s Siri, ushering in an era
marked by advancements in speech recognition, NLP, and
machine learning. Today’s virtual assistants, exemplified by
Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung Bixby, have

interaction. With ongoing research and development, the future
promises even greater sophistication and integration, pro-
pelling innovation in AI, NLP, and human-computer interaction.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Existing evidence}

Eliminating the requirement for SQL expertise, the paper proposes a rule-based method for enabling natural language interaction with databases, empowering non-IT users. It outlines the essential components of a Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB) system, which comprises a database component for performing management operations and a language module for translation. The core of the methodology involves using Context-Free Grammar (CFG) to parse inputs in natural language, identifying relevant properties and SQL components necessary for constructing queries. Following development and evaluation, a prototype system demonstrated promise in efficiently translating English queries into SQL, facilitating seamless database access. By removing the necessity for SQL proficiency, the paper offers a rule-based approach to facilitate natural language interaction with databases, catering to non-IT individuals [5].

\subsection{Research Gap}
To make database querying easier for non-expert users, the article promotes the usage of Natural Language Interface systems, emphasizing the importance of allowing interactions in plain language as opposed to SQL. To translate natural language questions into standard SQL queries, it presents a Rule-Based Approach. An evaluation and construction of a prototype system showed promising results when applying this strategy. However, the research also acknowledges that despite prior attempts and some performance gains, developing effective systems continues to present challenges [5].

The absence of a Voice-Based Virtual Assistant  introduces several difficulties for users interacting with digital systems. Firstly, users face increased manual input overload, having to rely on laborious typing or tapping techniques. Additionally, the lack of hands-free engagement deprives users of convenient operations, especially in situations where manual involvement is impractical. Digital technologies that require manual input can pose accessibility challenges for people with disabilities. Moreover, without voice-based interactions, the efficiency of operations decreases, leading to lower productivity. Finally, multitasking becomes less effective without a VBVA, as manually switching between apps is time-consuming and inefficient. Overall, integrating a VBVA addresses these issues, enhancing accessibility, productivity, and user experience in digital interactions [11].
When it comes to conversational systems, the difficulty lies in controlling syntactic-morphological structures, as differences in sentence construction might result in errors such as not realizing the connection between "hi" and "hello." Moreover, managing consecutive turns is problematic because responses like "yes" are frequently misconstrued as unknown, making the conversation less natural. Furthermore, there are complications with the overall conversation structure, as systems might not support normal conversational stages, leading to greetings at inappropriate times. These problems highlight the need for improved conversational systems that can better handle the nuances of human communication [6].

The paper describes the creation of "JARVIS," an artificial intelligence voice assistant, emphasizing the functionality and technological integration of the system. As an all-in-one personal assistant for users, JARVIS skillfully combines AIML, gTTS, and Python technologies to carry out activities including media retrieval, web searches, and weather updates. Nevertheless, a few drawbacks and problems are noted, such as the lack of specific features, platform dependence, and system vulnerability. To increase response capabilities, the document suggests future upgrades, including expanding the database and training sets and improving accessibility through user interface optimization. It also addresses important issues and potential advancements for AI voice assistants such as JARVIS [2].The system requires a minimum of 500 MB RAM and a
high-speed system with a powerful operating system [9]

\section{Material Method}
Speech recognition is a software feature that enables a computer program to record and comprehend spoken words. This functionality is implemented through the speech recognition library, allowing the software to capture spoken words or phrases from audio input received via a microphone. Subsequently, it translates these utterances into text, facilitating further analysis and comprehension by the application. Additionally, speech recognition enables various speech-driven features such as voice commands and dictation, fostering easy and natural interaction between users and computers [4].

The most innate form of human communication is speech. Computers can serve as a bridge between human specialists and robots, enabling the latter to consistently and accurately respond to human voices in order to understand human communication. A text-to-speech recognition device can facilitate this process. It allows a data processor to precisely understand the language in which a message was written and convert it into an audio file that can be played on a speaker or other sound device. The objective of the study is to introduce a text-to-speech model using the Python programming language and determine its ability to comprehend written words. Text-to-speech conversion was successful with the Google API [7].
The Gemini API by Google provides access to cutting-edge generative AI models, collectively known as Gemini, designed to accept text and image prompts and generate text responses. These models signify a significant advancement in multimodal AI technology, enabling diverse applications in content generation, data analysis, and problem-solving. Users can explore detailed model information and capabilities through the Gemini models page, which lists available models and retrieves metadata for specific ones. With the capability to handle both text and media inputs, Gemini opens up numerous possibilities, although prompts must adhere to a 20MB size limit. To overcome this limitation, the API includes a File API for temporarily storing media files, expanding the potential for prompt data. Overall, the Gemini API empowers developers to leverage state-of-the-art generative models for various creative and analytical tasks, fostering innovation in AI-driven content creation and interaction [8].
With the assistance of Vertex AI, a platform provided by Google Cloud, developers and data scientists can create, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at scale using a variety of tools and services. Through the Google Cloud client library, developers can easily utilize Vertex AI in Python, enabling programmatic interaction with its services. Python developers can effectively manage various machine learning tasks with Vertex AI. In addition to Python libraries like Pandas, they can utilize Vertex AI’s data preparation capabilities to ensure that datasets are clean and ready for training. Developers can build and configure training jobs using Python scripts, thanks to Vertex AI’s flexibility and compatibility. Vertex AI provides infrastructure that supports major machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for model training. Furthermore, Vertex AI streamlines the hyperparameter tuning process by automating the optimization procedure based on [10]. Python gives a strong environment for the development of this type of prototype which use the latest tech stack and build-in libraries providing a strong developing environment as well for the developer team. the cost depends on the number of words per search type or spoken by the user to the system for the advance version of personalization in a particular system. the system learns by itself to give the best result s possible according to the prompt set by the developer team. 

\subsection{Procedure}
The flowchart depicts the sequential steps involved
in the procedure followed by the Storyteller project.
Here’s a detailed explanation of each step:
Start: The process begins with the system being
activated, indicating its readiness to interact with the user.
Listening for Speech: The system enters a state where it
actively listens for speech input from the
user. Check if Voice is Clear: Before proceeding with
speech recognition, the system verifies the clarity of the
user’s voice input. [14] This step ensures that the speech
recognition process is accurate and reliable. Speech
Recognition: Once the voice clarity is confirmed, the
system utilizes speech recognition techniques to
convert the spoken words into text format, making it
easier for the system to interpret and process the user’s
commands. Check for Google Gemini Commands: The
system analyzes the recognized text to identify specific
commands related to the Google Gemini API, such as
requests to write, generate, or tell a story. This step
determines the subsequent actions to be taken based on
the user’s commands. Prompt for Education Story: If the
user requests a story, the system prompts the user to
provide input or selects predefined prompts related to
educational storytelling.This interaction ensures that the
generated story aligns with the educational objectives of
the project. Story Generation: Using the input provided
by the user or predefined prompts, the system uti- lizes
the Google Gemini API to generate an engaging and
interactive story. This step leverages advanced
generative models to create story content tailored to the
user’s preferences and educational requirements.
Synthesize Story Speech: Once the story is generated, the
system converts the text into speech format using text to-speech synthesis techniques. This enables the
narration of the story to the user, enhancing the
storytelling experience by providing an audible output.
End: The process concludes after the story is synthesized
and presented to the user. The system awaits further
interaction or termination, depending on the user’s
actions. Overall, the flowchart outlines the systematic
flow of actions undertaken by the Storyteller project in
response to user interaction, from speech input and
recognition to story generation and synthesis, facilitated
by the integration of the Google Gemini API.
