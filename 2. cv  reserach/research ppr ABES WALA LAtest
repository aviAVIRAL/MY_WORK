\section{Introduction}
The field of natural language processing (NLP) has a long and illustrious past, filled with notable innovations and turning points across several decades. The idea of assessing a machine’s capacity for human like intelligence was first put forth by Alan Turing in the 1950s, when he developed the Turing Test. This is where NLP got its start. The earliest computer systems for language translation were developed throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s. One notable example is the Georgetown IBM experiment, which translated Russian phrases into English. Rule based systems and early attempts at language syntactic and semantic analysis emerged in the 1970s. NLP saw a move in the 1980s toward statistical methods due to advancements in computational linguistics and machine learning. During this time, methods like statistical machine translation, n-gram language models, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) gained popularity. NLP has advanced as a result of the advent of massive text corpora and the creation of algorithms for named entity recognition, parsing, and part of speech tagging. In NLP, the 2000s saw a dramatic shift toward machine learning based techniques, especially with the emergence of deep learning techniques. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transformer models are examples of deep learning architectures that have revolutionized numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks and achieved state of the art performance in domains including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. Advances in NLP have been further fueled by pre-trained language models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), which allow for transfer learning and fine tuning for a variety of downstream tasks. NLP includes a wide range of jobs and analyses. While semantic analysis focuses on comprehending the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences, syntax analysis examines the grammatical structure of sentences to grasp their syntactic links. Discourse analysis and conversational agent design are examples of pragmatic analysis, which takes into account the context and goal of language use in communication. While information retrieval and extraction deal with finding and extracting pertinent information from massive text collections or unstructured data sources, text creation creates text that appears human based on input. Sentiment analysis seeks to ascertain the sentiment or opinion expressed in text, machine translation concentrates on automatically translating text from one language to another, and question answering is the design of systems that can understand questions posed in natural language and provide precise answers. Often referred to as chatbots or conversational agents, dialogue systems converse with users in natural language, comprehending their questions and offering pertinent answers in a conversational style. The history of virtual assistants traces back to the early 1960s with the emergence of artificial intelligence and human computer interaction concepts. Early prototypes like ”Shakey the Robot” showcased the potential for machines to perceive and interact with their environment. In the 1980s and 1990s, intelligent software agents and expert systems laid the foundation for virtual assistants capable of understanding natural language and performing tasks within specific domains. The term ”virtual assistant” gained prominence in the early 2000s with products like Microsoft’s Clippy and Apple’s Siri, marking the beginning of a new era characterized by advancements in speech recognition, natural language processing, and machine learning. Today, virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung Bixby have evolved to be conversational, proactive, and integrated across various devices and services, reshaping how people interact with technology in their daily lives. With ongoing research and development, the future of virtual assistants promises even greater sophistication and integration, driving innovation in AI, natural language understanding, and human computer interaction fields.

The project’s goal is to improve job management and user experience by creating a voice activated smart virtual assistant that makes use of cutting edge machine learning and speech recognition technology. Together with a host of other functions, this assistant will be able to manage smart home devices, make calls, send messages, create reminders, and provide real time weather, news, and sports updates. The innovation is mostly in its context awareness and multilingual support, which allow for smooth cross language communication and customized solutions depending on previous exchanges. Prospective pursuits entail broadening the project’s scope to encompass platforms such as Raspberry Pi and including home automation functionalities, like managing lights and air conditioning, so augmenting its efficacy and adaptability. [11]
Built on the combination of gTTS (Google Text to Speech), Python, and AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), the JARVIS system is a virtual voice assistant that facilitates interactive conversations. Its development entails integrating various Python libraries with Google APIs, with a specific focus on improving text to speech and speech recognition features. Notably, JARVIS is specifically designed for the Linux operating system, with a deliberate focus on improving user friendliness via voice activated communication. In the future, possible improvements might take into account open source release, strengthen AI capabilities, and investigate automation and smart device integration applications. These developments demonstrate a dedication to continuous innovation and progress. [6]
JARVIS is an artificial intelligence voice assistant that uses Python and gTTS to provide customized support. It uses text to speech platforms and AIML to facilitate user system communication. JARVIS helps users with everyday chores including weather checks, media retrieval, web searches, and event scheduling. The paper explores important technical areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and neural networks that are essential to JARVIS’s operation. It also offers an in depth examination of the system architecture, speech recognition, and training methodology, giving a thorough understanding of how the system functions. [2]

\subsection{Research Gap}
In order to make database querying easier for nonexpert users, the article promotes the usage of plain Language Interface (NLI) systems, emphasizing the importance of allowing interactions in plain language as opposed to SQL. In order to translate natural language questions into standard SQL queries, it presents a Rule-Based Approach. An evaluation and construction of a prototype system showed promising results when applying this strategy. The research does, however, also recognize that despite prior attempts and some performance gains, developing effective NLI systems continues to present difficulties. [5]
The lack of a Voice Based Virtual Assistant (VBVA) makes a number of difficulties for users interacting with digital systems more difficult. First of all, users are forced to adopt laborious typing or tapping techniques due to a noticeable increase in manual input overload. Furthermore, users are deprived of convenient operations due to the absence of hands-free engagement, especially in scenarios when manual involvement is problematic. Digital technologies that require human input can provide accessibility challenges for people with disabilities. Moreover, without voice based interactions, the effectiveness of operations declines, resulting in lower productivity. Finally, without a VBVA, multitasking becomes less successful because manually switching between apps is time-consuming and ineffective. In general, these issues are resolved by integrating a VBVA, which improves accessibility, productivity, and user experience in digital interactions. [11]
When it comes to conversational systems, the difficulty lies in controlling syntactic-morphological structures, as differences in sentence construction might result in errors such as not realizing the connection between "hi" and "hello." Moreover, managing consecutive turns is problematic because answers such as "yes" are frequently misconstrued as unknown, which makes the conversation less natural. Furthermore, there are complications with the overall conversation structure because systems might not be able to support normal conversational stages, including greetings at the wrong times. These problems highlight the need for conversational AI to progress for complex comprehension and smoother interaction. [6]
The paper describes the creation of "JARVIS," an artificial intelligence voice assistant, emphasizing the functionality and technological integration of the system. As an all-in-one personal assistant for users, JARVIS skillfully combines AIML, gTTS, and Python technologies to carry out activities including media retrieval, web searches, and weather updates. Nevertheless, a few drawbacks and problems are noted, such as the lack of specific features, platform dependence, and system vulnerability. In order to increase response capabilities, the document suggests future upgrades including expanding the database and training sets, and improving accessibility through user interface optimization. It also addresses important issues and possible advancements for AI voice assistants such as JARVIS. [2]

System requirements include 500 MB+ RAM and a high-speed system with a powerful operating system. [9]

Jarvice Voice Assistant use a speech recognition system, NLM, and PyTorch technology. The issues are, it encounter difficulties in recognizing less common words, slang, or technical terminology and deepened on internet highy at least 5 Mbps speed. Result upon receiving a command, the assistant displays a Google search of the query and delivers the solution audibly back to the user. [2]


Jarvise an interpretation of AI-ML with integration  GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), Python, Pyttsx, Google API, Linux, Tkinter, and GTK+ (GIMP toolkit). It works only on Linux systems and can perform tasks such as playing music, changing wallpaper, and manipulating system volume.
the main issues in this system is only limited to some operating systems and devices are restricted also. [6]

ASkI the virtual desktop AI-based voice assistant use Python, speech recognition, pyttsx3, Pyaudio 3, Datetime, web browser, Wikipedia, os module, SMTP library. the system is capable of opening websites, play media, sending mail, etc. The issues are with hardware as it required hardware like a Corei3 processor and 512 MB RAM. it employs pyttsx 3 for text-to-speech conversion. it might not sound as natural as human speech. [9]

Voice-based virtual assistants use speech recognition, AI voice assistant, and text-to-speech. unique feature eliminates the need for manual input and provides convenience but the system is limited to multitasking without VBVA and multitasking is hindered as user must manually switch between applications and manual inputs are slower than voice inputs. [11]

Rule-based chatbots for student inquiries use artificial intergenic markup language(AIML), data analyzing tools and chat fuel to build bots. main feature is the simplicity of UI/UX design and interaction with the system. the limitations are we need specific keywords to get the desired output and lack of back-end access. [3]

A rule-based approach for NLP-based query processing use NLP and predefined rules and patterns with rule bases approach. It results in less response time and the issues are keyword-dependent, domain specificity, scalability, and limited coverage. [5]

\section{Material Method}

Speech recognition is a software feature that
allows a computer program to record and understand
spoken words. It is implemented through the speech
recognition library. them enables the software to pick up
spoken words or phrases from audio input received
through a microphone, translate them into text so the
application can analyze and comprehend them further,
and more. Voice commands, dictation, and other speech-driven features are made possible by this functionality,
which promotes easy and natural user-computer
interaction. [4]
The most innate form of human communication
is speech. Computers can serve as a bridge between
human specialists and robots, enabling the latter to
consistently and accurately respond to human voices to understand human communication. A text-to-speech recognition device can help with this. It enables a data processor to precisely understand the language
that a message was written in and convert it to an audio
file that can be played on a speaker or other sound
device. The study’s objective is to introduce a text-to-speech model using the Python programming language and determine whether written words are understood.
Text-to-speech conversion worked well with Google API. [7]

The Gemini API by Google offers access to cutting-edge generative AI models, collectively known as Gemini, designed to accept text and image prompts and produce text responses. These models represent a significant
advancement in multi-modal AI technology, allowing for
diverse applications in content generation, data
analysis, and problem-solving. Users can explore
detailed model information and capabilities through the
Gemini models page, listing available models and
retrieving metadata for specific ones. With the ability to
handle both text and media input, Gemini opens up
numerous possibilities, although prompts must adhere
to a 20MB size limit. To overcome this limitation, the API
includes a File API for temporarily storing media files,
expanding the potential for prompt data. Overall, the
Gemini API empowers developers to leverage state-of-the-art generative models for various creative and analytical tasks, driving innovation in AI-driven content creation and interaction. [8]

With the help of Vertex
AI, a platform provided by Google Cloud, developers, and
data scientists can create, train, and implement machine
learning (ML) models at scale with a variety of tools and
services. Through the Google Cloud client library,
developers may easily use Vertex AI in Python, enabling
programmatic interaction with its services. Python
developers can effectively handle a variety of machine
learning tasks with Vertex AI. Along with Python libraries
like Pandas, they may use Vertex AI’s data preparation
capabilities to data, guaranteeing that datasets are clean
and prepared for training. Developers may build and
configure training jobs using Python scripts thanks to
Vertex AI’s managed infrastructure, which supports major machine
learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Py-Torch for
model training. Furthermore, Vertex AI streamlines the
hyperparameter tuning process by automating the
optimization procedure based on. [10]

In my storytellers system, I used the Latest 2024 Google Gemini API with the assistance of prompt engineering to create prompts that generate personalized stories relevant to children's education. For example, if the user's name is Aviral, the story will start with Aviral as a character in the story.
In my Algorithm, I import several Python libraries, for example :
 OS, pyaudio, speech recognition, Google Cloud text to speech, temp file, pygame, and web browser.
 
use the latest version of speech recognition to recognize human speech correctly and remove noiseand PortAudio, which allows to play and record audio with Python without any interferences of over write stack which is waiting to complete.  
Pygame is a set of Python modules which mostly used in video gaming designing but here. we use this in the storyteller system in the form of computer graphics and sound libraries.
