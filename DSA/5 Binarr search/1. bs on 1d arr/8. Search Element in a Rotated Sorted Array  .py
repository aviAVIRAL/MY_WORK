# Search Element in a Rotated Sorted Array
# Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

# Examples
# Example 1:
# Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
# Result: 4
# Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

# Example 2:
# Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
# Result: -1
# Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1


# brute linear search 

def search(arr, n, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            return i
    return -1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    n = 9
    k = 1
    ans = search(arr, n, k)
    if ans == -1:
        print("Target is not present.")
    else:
        print("The index is:", ans)

# Optimal (Using Binary Search):  O(logN)   sc 1

def search(arr, n, k):
    low = 0
    high = n - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2

        # if mid points the target
        if arr[mid] == k:
            return mid

        # if left part is sorted
        if arr[low] <= arr[mid]:
            if arr[low] <= k and k <= arr[mid]:
                # element exists
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                # element does not exist
                low = mid + 1
        else:  # if right part is sorted
            if arr[mid] <= k and k <= arr[high]:
                # element exists
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                # element does not exist
                high = mid - 1
    return -1

    n = 9
    k = 1
    ans = search(arr, n, k)
    if ans == -1:
        print("Target is not present.")
